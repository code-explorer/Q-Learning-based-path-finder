# Q-Learning-based-path-finder

## About the project
A path finding algorithm implementation using Q-Learning.

The primary goal of the algorithm is to find the most cost effective path for a robot to go from point A to point B while avoiding some obstacles.

The secondary goal is to find the best set of parameters for the q-learning algorithm.

For more details refer to the jupyter notebook.
